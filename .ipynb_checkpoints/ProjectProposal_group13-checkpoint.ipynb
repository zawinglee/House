    "* Why is this question of interest to your group?<br>\n",
    "Airbnb is a platform where house owners offer their house for lodgings and homestays. Nowadays, it is becoming a more popular choice of staying in other cities for short periods of time. The listing price of Airbnb is an important factor for both owners and visitors to consider. For owners, one thing is how the profit they get from airbnb, which is directly related to the listing price, compares to the actual value of their apartment. This may affect their decision of whether or not to run their apartment as an airbnb. Another thing they will consider is how many other airbnbs are running nearby. The competition around a certain area may also have an impact on the listing price they decide. On the other hand, for visitors, they will take into account both the price of the offered apartment and certain characteristics of the surrounding neighborhood (including local home prices, nearby transit options, etc). Therefore, we decided to study whether there is a relationship between the neighborhoods and listing price. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to focus our study on Airbnbs in San Francisco. This is becuase our group members stayed in Airbnbs when traveling to San Francisco. When searching for places to stay, we spent a lot of time comparing different listings based on their neighborhoods and prices. We believe many travelors have the same experience, and hope our study can help them make their decisions in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "* What background information led you to your hypothesis?<br>\n",
    "Previous study has reported the price heat map of Airbnbs in San Francisco[1]. It can be seen from the map that certain areas have higher prices while others have lower prices. This shows that geographical location has an impact on listing prices of Airbnb. To further investigate the characteristics of these geographical locations, we’ve found that the area with higher price overlaps with the area with more public transportation facilities and more available airbnb houses (based on the San Francisco transportation map and Airbnb map)[2][3]. As a result, we propose that there is a positive correlation between the listing price of airbnb and the two factors listed above, namely the accessibility of nearby public transportation and the densities of nearby listing airbnbs. We also assume that different areas likely have different house prices in general. Therefore, the nearby home price is also likely to have an impact on the listing price of an airbnb. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "* Why is this important?<br>\n",
    "These questions are important because they lead us to better understand how the facilities and market competition of the neighborhoods affect the running of Airbnb. Moreover, the result can also serve as a reference for house owners to better decide whether they would like to set their house as Airbnb and what price they should set, and for visitors to better choose where they should stay. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "* What has already been done on this topic? What is already known?<br>\n",
    "Previous related work has shown that proximity to public transit leads to higher property value and rental price [4]. Airbnb can be seen as one kind of short renting. This further motivates us to see if the findings can be applied to the case of Airbnb prices. \n",

    "- Data collection:<br>\n",
    "The greatest majority of our data are collected from Inside Airbnb, which provide datasets that contain comprehensive Airbnb information based on cities. On the website, it clearly states that all these data displayed are sourced from the Airbnb site which is available to the public. Therefore, there will be no privacy concern for analyzing these open data. To prevent violation of data privacy, we also check on the terms of use of other two data sites and ensure we have the permission to utilize them for further analysis purposes.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "- Data analysis:<br>\n",
    "In addition, we managed to limit personally identifiable information exposure. We noticed that data such as: host ID, host name and location, in our dataset reveals a great deal of Airbnb host’s personal information. This could cause privacy issues if being misused to track on the host. Moreover, there is a possibility that these data are inaccurate due to misspelling or lack of updating. Since our objectives have nothing to deal with the location and name of the host, therefore we would like to drop “host_id”, “host_url”, “host_name” “host_location” columns from our datasets.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potential use of our analysis:<br>\n",
    "There are some parties that might be interested in our analysis. It could be potential customers who intend to book an Airbnb in San Francisco or new hosts who are planning to start running his or her own Airbnb. Our concern is that our analysis conclusion may negatively affect hosts’ business survival or customers’ benefits. For instance, suppose one of our findings illustrates the strong correlation between the density of listings and listing prices, some hosts who set relatively high prices among Airbnb intensive neighborhoods may have to lower their price in order to remain competitive, even though their profit is already low. This could put threats on their business survival. On the other hand, hosts who realized there are fewer competitors in their neighborhood may set their price especially high which could harm customers’ benefits. Therefore, since we only investigate the relationship between several factors of our interests and the listing price, to minimize the possible negative consequence, we will make it clear that the correlations we justified are not the only variables that contribute to the discrepancy in Airbnb price in San Francisco. There are still other significant factors that would affect the listing price.<br>\n"
